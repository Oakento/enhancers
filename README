Scripts for localization of transcribed enhancers and quntification of their usage from the initiation sites of bidirectionally transcribed loci.
Used for identifying transcribed enhancers across FANTOM5 samples in Andersson R et al. 2014. An atlas of active enhancers across human cell types and tissues. Nature. doi:10.1038/nature12787

REQUIREMENTS
bedtools: http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools

USAGE
The main program is scripts/bidir_enhancers which relies on utility scripts in bin/ (this hierarchy of directories is assumed in bidir_enhancers).
The required arguments are the path to a file listing paths to bed files with transcription initiation sites (1 bp) and an output path.
If you want to filter bidirectionally transcribed loci to not be near known TSSs or exons you need to pass the path to a mask file (bed) for filtering.
Mask file used in Andersson et al. 2014 is available in the mask directory.
